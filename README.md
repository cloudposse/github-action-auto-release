This is an opinionated composite Github Action that implements a workflow based on the popular `release-drafter` action to automatically draft releases with release notes that are derived from PR descriptions as they are merged into the default branch. ```

Under default settings, `auto-release` will also cut a new release from the default branch after every merge into it. However, releases are not cut for merges of pull requests with a `no-release` label attached. In that case, the release notes are left as a draft and a release with all unreleased changes will be made the next time a pull request without the `no-release` label is merged into the default branch.







## Usage

Copy the `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` and `.github/configs/release-drafter.yml` files from this repository into the corresponding folders of the repository to which you'd like to add Auto-release functionality.
This will trigger the `auto-release` functionality every time merges are made into the default branch.


## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...
1. Copy the `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` github action workflow from this repository into the corresponding folder of the target repo
2. Copy the `.github/configs/release-drafter.yml` auto-release config file from this repository into the corresponding folder of the target repo
3. Customize the config file as desired, per the [config documentation](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter#configuration)
## Examples

Here's a real world example:
- [`github-action-auto-release`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-auto-release/.github/workflows/auto-release.yml) - The self-testing Cloud Posse Auto-format GitHub Action
