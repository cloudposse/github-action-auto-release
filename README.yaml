# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is an opinionated composite Github Action that implements a workflow based on the popular `release-drafter` action to automatically draft releases with release notes that are derived from PR descriptions are they are merged into the default branch. ```

  Under default settings, `auto-release` will also cut a new release from the default branch after every merge into it. However, releases are not cut for merges of pull requests with a `no-release` label attached. In that case, the release notes are left as a draft and a release with all unreleased changes will be made the next time a pull request without the `no-release` label is merged into the default branch.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  Copy the `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` and `.github/auto-release.yml` files from this repository into the corresponding folders of the repository to which you'd like to add Auto-release functionality.
  This will cause Auto-release functionality to execute whenever merges are made into the default branch.

# Example usage
